Hello!

I'm Basel, a computer science student currently enrolled at [SMU](https://www.smu.ca).

A little bit about myself:
- I like to code (obviously)
- I draw _occasionally_
- [Football](https://github.com/BOLT-7/BOLT-7/blob/main/football.jpg) player
- RPG enthusiast (tabletop/videogames)
- [Pokemon Professor](https://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/organize)

<!---
BOLT-7/BOLT-7 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
